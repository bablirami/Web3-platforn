A full-featured Web3 content marketplace built with JavaScript, Node.js (Express), PostgreSQL, and Solana Web3.js.
The platform enables creators to upload and sell exclusive digital collections using the Phantom wallet and Solana blockchain for fast, low-fee transactions.
It features a multi-language interface (RU/EN), user authentication via JWT and Solana wallet login, a creator dashboard for managing and uploading media, and a secure transaction system that verifies payments directly on-chain.
The front end uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3, and rich Three.js visuals (animated ribbons and particle effects) to deliver a polished, immersive user experience.
The backend handles file uploads, access key generation, and transaction validation, while also exposing APIs for collection browsing and purchases.
